Version : 0.1 (04/07/2020)

To run the .py (source) version, you'll need :
- to have python 3.6 or more
- the Pillow (PIL fork) library
it should work on both windows and linux.
otherwise if you're on windows you can directly use
the .exe released on github.

When you have all of this simply run the MAIN.py file.
